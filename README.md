# python_api_challenge

This challenge utilizes two APIs to help plan a vacation based on different weather variables. After randomly pulling 1500 locations and their weather patterns for today, we are able to determine that latitude and temperature have the strongest statistical variables, and we are not able to use latitude to find vacation locations with ideal cloudiness, humidity and wind speeds.
Utilizing this finding, we condense potential locations to those with temperatures between 21-27, wind speeds less than 4.5 and 0 cloudiness today. 
The second API connection (GEOAPIFY) is used to streamline finding hotels in these ideal weather locations.

This analysis was created using in-class lessons and demonstrations, as well as personal notes.
